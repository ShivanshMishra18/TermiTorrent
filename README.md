# TermiTorrent
Yes, you read that right. This time it will be a torrent client. 

So, here's the plan.
I have most of my projects done with creating a back end, doing something and again creating a back end doing something different. However, a few days ago I wanted to know the difference between (mu)torrent and BitTorent, and I came to know that BitTorent is just a protocol to transfer content while the former is a client which uses this protocol to send and receive the content.

With this new repo started, your friendly neighborhood NodeFan would be first going through how BitTorrent works in a very Layman's way then for a few days I will be putting details about the main aspects of the protocol.

It will take (I don't know how long) until I find a good way to get the actual implementations done.
