## Playground

Welcome to the playground section. If you have come this far, we assume that you are comfortable with the underlying concepts required to actually build the software.

This section mainly contains some advanced concepts of NodeJS used for various purposes in the project along with comments which will be useful while implementing various functions. If it will be required, we will also add some test files in this folder itself.
